      <description>Hi,
This post is an homage to a stackoverflow post copying data from s3. This shared work saved me a lot of time. I believe that individuals who share their work do not receive sufficient recognition.
The problem is that I have multiple Gb of data separated into thousands of files. Those files are selected for download by the semi-automated pipeline for model training. So the number of files to download varies from pipeline run to pipeline run.</description>

      <title>Training a language model from scratch</title>

      <description>Hi,
This post is a short overview over a work project, where I trained a language model for invoices. This so-called base model is then fine-tuned for text classification on customer data. Due to data privacy, a non-disclosure agreement, ISO 27001 and SOAP2, I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to publish any results. Believe me, it works like üöÄ‚ú®ü™ê.
A language model is trained on large amounts of textual data to understand the patterns and structure of language.</description>

      <description>Hi,
Recently, I started to put some scripts together and run them against a Kaggle dataset. I decided to train my skills on an unseen dataset. Training keeps me sharp, and I need it to complement my skill set. For the last 2,5 years, I struggled in a small team with NLP problems, where I worked mostly on engineering tasks. My understanding in this area is not where I wanted to be.</description>

      <title>Stratified multi-label split</title>

      <description>Hi,
This post is a short overview of a stratified multi-label train-test split. Please look at the colab implementation for a step through guide.
Sometimes you step into work problems, which justify a small post. I already saw colleagues struggling to balance the train-test split for multi-label classification. In classification problems, we have often a dataset with an imbalanced number of classes. In general, it is desired to keep the proportions of each label for the train and test sets as observed as in the original dataset.</description>

      <title>Understanding scaled-dot product attention and multi-head attention</title>

      <description>Hi,
This post is a summary of my implementation of the scaled-dot product attention and multi-head attention. Please have a look at the colab implementation for a step through guide.
Even though this post is five years too late, the best way of reviving knowledge is to write about it. Transformers are in transforming the world via ChatGPT, Bart, or LLama. The core of the transformer architecture is the self-attention layer.</description>

      <description>Hi,
In this initial post, I want to draft the development of my FastAPI skeleton.
At the beginning of my career as a Data Scientist, I ran into the typical problem of model deployment to production. In a team of two scientists, I had the chance to write a micro-service with Flask from scratch out of necessity.
My first service followed strongly the example of Miguel Grinbergs great tutorial. The reason was simple, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write proper code at this time.</description>
