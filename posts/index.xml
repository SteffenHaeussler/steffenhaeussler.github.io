      <description>Hi,
This post is a summary of my implementation of the scaled-dot product attention and multi-head attention. Please have a look at the colab implementation for a step through guide.
Even though this post is five years too late, the best way of reviving knowledge is to write about it. Transformers are in transforming the world via ChatGPT, Bart, or LLama. The core of the transformer architecture is the self-attention layer.</description>

      <description>Hi,
In this initial post, I want to draft the development of my FastAPI skeleton.
At the beginning of my career as a Data Scientist, I ran into the typical problem of model deployment to production. In a team of two scientists, I had the chance to write a micro-service with Flask from scratch out of necessity.
My first service followed strongly the example of Miguel Grinbergs great tutorial. The reason was simple, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write proper code at this time.</description>
