<p>In this initial post, I want to draft the development of my <a href="https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/fastapi_skeleton/">FastAPI skeleton</a>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of my career as a Data Scientist, I ran into the typical problem of model deployment to production.
In a team of two scientists, I had the chance to write a micro-service <a href="https://github.com/SteffenHaeussler/flask_skeleton">with Flask from scratch</a> out of necessity.</p>
<p>My first service followed strongly the example of <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">Miguel Grinbergs great tutorial</a>. The reason was simple, I couldn&rsquo;t write proper code at this time. Besides no experience and the great help of my co-workers, I could write a production-ready micro-service in a few weeks with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>endpoint versioning</li>
<li>proper error handling</li>
<li>background streaming to s3 via kafka</li>
