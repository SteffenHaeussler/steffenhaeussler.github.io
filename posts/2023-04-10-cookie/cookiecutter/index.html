Also, I stop lying to myself by copy-pasting the solutions from others. Copy-paste rarely works when you need to describe the solution. On the other side, why should I add my poor code/understanding in public? There is the fear of not being good enough. What if my knowledge is outdated, shallow, or just wrong?

Knowledge changes over time, and everyone has full-time work and social life. Staying up-to-date is hard work, and forgetting nothing seems impossible. It is more valuable to evaluate the process of approaching a problem. The first part is honesty. What do I know - where are my weaknesses - which area needs my attention? If you are not honest with yourself, you canâ€™t learn. Afterward, when you are clear about your knowledge, you can specify your gaps and try to close them. In my view, the learning process is the most valuable professional trait.
