  <div class="post-content"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently, I had to work on a simple time-series analysis. I performed poorly since I never worked with time-series before.
I believe in a deterministic world, and in general, I prefer to find the causality of a specific data behavior prior to a simple way of empiristic modeling. However, I understand the need for time-series analysis as not enough data available, the underlying processes understood, the complexity bearable, or the time/need for a proper process understanding. The goal is to make a prediction based on the previously observed observations. In a traditional sense (Arima), you look at the trend, seasonality, and cycles - in the more modern way, you throw the data into a model architecture (deep learning). In this context, I should mention the famous paper <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-3/Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a/10.1214/ss/1009213726.pdf">Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures</a>, while I prefer to use algorithmic models and treat the data mechanism as unknown.
