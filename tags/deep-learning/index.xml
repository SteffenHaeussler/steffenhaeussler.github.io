      <description>Hi,
In my first post, I looked into the explainability of classical machine learning models. As a next step, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the explainability of neural networks. Model explainability is easy for simple models (linear regression, decision trees), and some tools exist for more complex algorithms (ensemble trees). Therefore, I highly recommend the book Interpretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar for a deeper theoretical understanding. All different approaches for model explanability are shown with a PyTorch model in this kaggle notebook.</description>

      <description>Hi,
Recently, I had to work on a simple time-series analysis. I performed poorly since I never worked with time-series before. I believe in a deterministic world, and in general, I prefer to find the causality of a specific data behavior prior to a simple way of empiristic modeling. However, I understand the need for time-series analysis as not enough data available, the underlying processes understood, the complexity bearable, or the time/need for a proper process understanding.</description>
