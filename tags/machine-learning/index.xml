      <title>Learning about time-series analysis</title>

      <description>Hi,
Recently, I had to work on a simple time-series analysis. I performed poorly since I never worked with time-series before. I believe in a deterministic world, and in general, I prefer to find the causality of a specific data behavior prior to a simple way of empiristic modeling. However, I understand the need for time-series analysis as not enough data available, the underlying processes understood, the complexity bearable, or the time/need for a proper process understanding.</description>

      <title>Training a language model from scratch</title>

      <description>Hi,
This post is a short overview over a work project, where I trained a language model for invoices. This so-called base model is then fine-tuned for text classification on customer data. Due to data privacy, a non-disclosure agreement, ISO 27001 and SOAP2, I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to publish any results. Believe me, it works like üöÄ‚ú®ü™ê.
A language model is trained on large amounts of textual data to understand the patterns and structure of language.</description>

      <description>Hi,
Recently, I started to put some scripts together and run them against a Kaggle dataset. I decided to train my skills on an unseen dataset. Training keeps me sharp, and I need it to complement my skill set. For the last 2,5 years, I struggled in a small team with NLP problems, where I worked mostly on engineering tasks. My understanding in this area is not where I wanted to be.</description>

      <title>Stratified multi-label split</title>
      <link>https://steffenhaeussler.github.io/posts/multi_label_split/</link>

      <description>Hi,
This post is a short overview of a stratified multi-label train-test split. Please look at the colab implementation for a step through guide.
Sometimes you step into work problems, which justify a small post. I already saw colleagues struggling to balance the train-test split for multi-label classification. In classification problems, we have often a dataset with an imbalanced number of classes. In general, it is desired to keep the proportions of each label for the train and test sets as observed as in the original dataset.</description>

      <title>Understanding scaled-dot product attention and multi-head attention</title>

      <description>Hi,
This post is a summary of my implementation of the scaled-dot product attention and multi-head attention. Please have a look at the colab implementation for a step through guide.
Even though this post is five years too late, the best way of reviving knowledge is to write about it. Transformers are in transforming the world via ChatGPT, Bart, or LLama. The core of the transformer architecture is the self-attention layer.</description>
