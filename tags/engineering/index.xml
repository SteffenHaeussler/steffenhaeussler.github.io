      <description>Hi,
In my previous job, I spent hours debugging internal data transformations to figure out the received data from an external API was faulty. This issue would not appeared with schema validation. My fault was that I trusted the incoming data and didnâ€™t check for data consistency. Learning from mistakes and saving time, I would set up a small example for JSON validation via Pydantic. FastAPI relies heavily on pydantic and I use it for validating the incoming request and outgoing response.</description>

      <description>Hi,
This post is an homage to a stackoverflow post copying data from s3. This shared work saved me a lot of time. I believe that individuals who share their work do not receive sufficient recognition.
The problem is that I have multiple Gb of data separated into thousands of files. Those files are selected for download by the semi-automated pipeline for model training. So the number of files to download varies from pipeline run to pipeline run.</description>

      <description>Hi,
In this initial post, I want to draft the development of my FastAPI skeleton.
At the beginning of my career as a Data Scientist, I ran into the typical problem of model deployment to production. In a team of two scientists, I had the chance to write a micro-service with Flask from scratch out of necessity.
My first service followed strongly the example of Miguel Grinbergs great tutorial. The reason was simple, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write proper code at this time.</description>
