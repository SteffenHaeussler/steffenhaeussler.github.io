      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was an interesting learning experience. I tried to commercialize a product, which in the end was much harder than expected.
As a short summary, the first attempt failed, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to sell the product. The pivot failed, because multiple big corporates released a similar product. Also the goal was to get 1-2 customers to build a MVP before looking for funding and so on. So I never incorporated the idea into a company. Basically, I failed already on the first meter, but this saved a lot of time. So I only invested 7
months. 🥲&lt;/p&gt;</description>
