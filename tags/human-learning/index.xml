      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to add another post to this year&amp;rsquo;s recap. After I described my three key learnings from my failed startup endeavor, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling finished or satisfied. Overall I&amp;rsquo;m not satisfied with what I learned this year. It feels very shallow without any hard skills behind it. In every year of my life, I learned a lot, independent of the later usefulness, but at least I can say, that I moved forward. This year, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like this. As Confucius said: &amp;ldquo;By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.&amp;rdquo; My learnings weren&amp;rsquo;t helpful at all and they came from experience.
To sum it up, the ratio of effort and outcome was very low and I definitely can do better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was an interesting learning experience. I tried to commercialize a product, which in the end was much harder than expected.
As a short summary, the first attempt failed, because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to sell the product. The pivot failed, because multiple big corporates released a similar product. Also the goal was to get 1-2 customers to build a MVP before looking for funding and so on. So I never incorporated the idea into a company. Basically, I failed already on the first meter, but this saved a lot of time. So I only invested 7
months. 🥲&lt;/p&gt;</description>
