      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started to put some scripts together and run them against a Kaggle dataset. I decided to train my skills on an unseen dataset. Training keeps me sharp, and I need it to complement my skill set. For the last 2,5 years, I struggled in a small team with NLP problems, where I worked mostly on engineering tasks. My understanding in this area is not where I wanted to be. And on top, I follow this natural human process called forgetting things. For example, I definitely can&amp;rsquo;t write all relevant stochiometric formulas of the chemo-lithotrophic denitrification by memory. This was very important during my Ph.D. When did I start to forget relevant information? It&amp;rsquo;s funny to think back.  ðŸ¤·&lt;/p&gt;</description>
