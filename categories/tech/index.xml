      <description>Hi,
In this initial post, I want to draft the development of my FastAPI.
At the beginning of my career as a Data Scientist, I ran into the typical problem of model deployment to production. In a team of two scientists, I had the chance to write a micro-service with Flask from scratch out of necessity.
My first service followed strongly the example of Miguel Grinbergs great tutorial. The reason was simple, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t code at this time.</description>
